INGREDIENTS :-

1. two 4-ounce quality semi-sweet chocolate bars (113g each) (finely chopped) 
2. 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream

PROCEDURE :-

1. Place chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. 

2. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil– that’s too hot!) 

3. Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate.

4. With a metal spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. 

5. Ganache can be ready to use as a drizzle or you can let it sit at room temperature to cool and thicken. It will fully cool within 2 hours.

6. Once completely cool and thick, the ganache can be piped with a piping tip or scooped with a spoon. You can also beat the cooled thickened ganache with a handheld or stand mixer   
fitted with a whisk attachment until light in color and texture, about 4 minutes on medium-high speed.

7. Cover tightly and store ganache in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Once ganache cools completely, you can cover it tightly and freeze it for up to 3 months. Thaw in the 
refrigerator. 

8. To rewarm or thin out again, stir constantly over low heat on the stove in either (1) a double boiler or (2) in a heatproof bowl placed over a pot of simmering water. Don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the simmering water.


NOTES :-

1. The finer you chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt with the cream. If it’s not melting, do not microwave it. 
2. Refrigerating speeds this up, but the ganache will not cool evenly. Stir it a few times as it sets in the refrigerator so it remains even and smooth.
3. You can easily halve or double this recipe. No matter how much ganache you are making, you always need equal parts chocolate and cream.
4.  Use full-fat canned coconut milk. Shake it up before opening. Whisk on the stove as it heats and bring to a simmer. Measure 1 cup (240ml). Use instead of warm heavy cream.
